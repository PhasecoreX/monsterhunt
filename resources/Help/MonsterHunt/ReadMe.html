	<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
	<p>
		Welcome to Monster Hunt!! Monster Hunt (MH from
		now on) is a modification for Unreal Tournament (UT from now on) that allows
		you and your team of hunters to fight your way through hoards of monsters attempting
		to prevent you from escaping. MH is played in specially designed maps (see
		"<a href="#mapping">Mapping for Monster Hunt</a>") full of monsters that appeared in
		the original Unreal (and hopefully many new ones in the future), and at the end of
		each map, you'll be faced with a Boss monster (or a few :-) that must be defeated to
		continue.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can also try out Monster Arena, you and your
		team must enter an arena with the biggest, badest, most powerful monsters you're
		likely to face anywhere and beat the hell out of them to survive!
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
	<p>
		MH requires that you have UT patch 436 or higher installed to run, though OldUnreal
		patch 469 could be preferred.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can get the latest patches from one of the following sites:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://unrealarchive.org/patches-updates/unreal-tournament/patches/index.html">Unreal Archive</a></li>

	<h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay Changes</h2>
	<p>
	<h3>Monster Hunt</h3>
	</p>
	<p>
		Teamplay has a strong role in successfully completing
		a Hunt, if players don't work as a team to accomplish objectives, they'll no
		doubt all end up dead pretty soon, those monsters don't fool around! Sharing
		pickups also becomes important, if one player grabs everything, the rest are
		left with nothing and will end up dead.
	</p>
	<p>
		Because of the nature of MH, players may be faced
		with the occasional puzzle to solve, but they won't be as in-depth as a single
		player game might have - the emphasis is on action, not brainstorming.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Translocator has been disabled in MH games,
		as it could spoil certain scenarios. The Chainsaw replaces the Impact Hammer
		as the default weapon for all that hack and slash goodness it provides :-)
	</p>
	<p>
	<h3>Monster Arena</h3>
	</p>
	<p>
		Much like a traditional DeathMatch, but you're
		not playing against other players, you and your team are battling it out to
		the death against giant bloodthirsty monsters.
	</p>
	<p>
		Players all start in an area protected from the
		monsters. Here, they have a chance to grab the weapons they'll be needing in
		the battle to come - there are no other weapons other than those provided at
		the start, you will however, be able to find ammo in the arena itself. Once
		the monster(s) are killed, you will automatically be taken to the next arena.
	</p>
	<p>
	<h3>Monster Defence</h3>
	</p>
	<p>
		Monster Defence is played on regular CTF maps. Players must protect their flag
		base from invading hoards of monsters, and prevent them from escaping through
		the portal they have managed to open.
	</p>
	<p>
		To win the round, players must hold out until the time limit is reached - the
		monsters are endless and cannot be stopped! The round will be lost if enough
		monsters escape through the portal, or all players lives have been exhausted.
	</p>

	<p>
	<h3>Monster Hunt</h3>
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Before you start on a map, open the MonsterHunt.u package in the class-browser so you have access to all the Monster Hunt-specific
			stuff.
		</li>
		<li>Maps should be more of a single player style,
			but make sure there are enough pickups for all the players and that there's
			enough space for a group of players to move around in.
		</li>
		<li>Boss monsters should be in large spacious areas,
			the players must be able to concentrate on defeating the monsters and not have
			to worry about the surrounding architecture.
		</li>
		<li>Make an escape route for the players to run
			through and place a MonsterEnd trigger (found in the classe-browser: Triggers
			-> Trigger -> MonsterEnd) where the players will run to end the level.
		</li>
		<li>If you want to add bot support to your map (very highly recommended), you can use the MonsterWaypoint actor (found in the
			classe-browser: Keypoint
			-> MonsterWaypoint). Just put the MonsterWaypoint actors wherever you want a bot waypoint to be, like near a button or a lever, or
			just along the path through the level. Set it's Position property to tell the bots in which order the waypoints must be visited. Set
			the first one at 1, the next at 2, then 3, and so on. You can also enter the Event tag of a particular actor so when the bot gets to
			the waypoint, something can be triggered to happen.
		</li>
		<li>Be sure to add lots of PlayerStarts at the beginning
			of the level to make sure the players don't telefrag each other when the round
			starts - about 12-18 will be enough for a normal size map.
		</li>
		<li>You can implement simple puzzles for the players
			to solve along the way, but don't use too many as players will probably get
			frustrated.
		</li>
		<li>Feel free to use as many special effects as
			you like, in this style of game, the players will really take note an think
			"How'd they do that???" :-)
		</li>
		<li>Remember that there is no Translocator, so don't
			make any situations where it's needed to progress.
		</li>
		<li>The difficulty of the map is important, start
			with relatively weak monsters and as players progress through the level, use
			stronger and stronger enemies.
		</li>
		<li>Make sure your Boss monster is pretty strong,
			players will be disappointed it only takes a few shots to kill it.
		</li>
		<li>Don't put any monsters near to where the players
			will start, they'll all be slaughtered as soon as they spawn.
		</li>
		<li>Environmental hazzards (slime, lava, huge drops,
			etc.) are great, but make sure the boss monster(s) can't fall in, or it'll spoil
			the fun of defeating them.
		</li>
		<li>Don't give the players the best guns at the
			beginning, or they'll mow through the monsters too easily.
		</li>
		<li>Use the MonsterEvent (under Triggers &gt; SpecialEvent)
			to display messages for the players, everything has already been pre-configured,
			just type the message and connect it to a trigger.
		</li>
		<li>Set the boss monster's bIsBoss to True so the player can get extra points for killing him.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	<h3>Monster Arena</h3>
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The same rules that apply to Monster Hunt maps
			apply to Monster Arena maps as well, but there are a few more things to keep
			in mind:
		</li>
		<li>Make sure you create a small protected area somewhere
			in the map that the players can safely spawn in, you can even seal it off by
			using a door.
		</li>
		<li>You should provide the players with some guns
			in the protected area but don't give them too many and make sure the weapons
			suit the arena and the monster to be killed.
		</li>
		<li>Place as much health and ammo around the arena as you like.</li>
		<li>Give the players lots of place to move in, and
			make sure the boss can't get stuck anywhere.
		</li>
		<li>Place a MonsterArenaEnd trigger in the map (found
			in the classes browser: Triggers -> Trigger -> MonsterEnd -> MonsterArenaEnd)
			and set an Event for the boss and set the Tag of the MonsterArenaEnd to correspond
			with the boss' Event. (<I>IMPORTANT! - Make sure you add the trigger in the
				centre of the map using the Top View</I>)
		</li>
	</ul>

			run out of lives, they are sent into spectator mode. When all players and bots
